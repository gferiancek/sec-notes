# SE Career Track Notes

This repo is used to house my notes while going through the Springboard SE Career Track. Each Unit, starting from unit 5 when we started using the Linux subsystem, will have it's own folder with a dedicated README.md.

The README.md file will contain notes for the entire unit, while each subunit folder contains the exercises/example code.

<sub>Since each unit could result in a lot of notes, especially later on, make sure to click the menu icon to open up an Outline that links to all headers!</sub>

**NOTE:** Since projects/assessments require their own repos, I've decided to just make the ungraded exercises on their own repos as well. This repo only contains my personal notes.
